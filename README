TODO APP

This web app have the porpose to create, edit and delete todo's.
Each user have their own list of todo. They can mark them as important or unimportant.
If ever a user has a lot of todo's entry, he can classify them in relation to their degree of importance.

Development report:
Two new features are added in top to those that already exist. An edit button to edit the information of a todo entry
and a filter button to display only important todo, unimportant todo, or all todo.
To handle the edit feature, a method have been created to handle this action. A form is used with POST method in order
to retrieve an updated version of a todo entry.
To handle the filter feature, a fieldset inside a form have been added to the html code. Then, the todolist() method
have been modified in order to handle multiple POST source. For example, when the user click in 'create' button, code
executed will be different to the 'ok' button ('ok' is the button that will confirm the filter choice).
